### Data Modeling
- Inspected the CSVs and made an Entity Relationship Diagram based on datasets.

### Data Engineering
- Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specified data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

### Data Analysis
Analyzed the complete dataset and made tables to each corresponding request:
- List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
- List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
- List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
- List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

#### To examine the "fake" data, a visualization of the data was generated using:
- A histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
- A bar chart of average salary by employee job title.
